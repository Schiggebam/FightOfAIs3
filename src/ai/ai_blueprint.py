    Example class for inter-player diplomatics. Events are defined in the constants.
    In principle, events have a lifetime, they will last at least this time.
    If the cause of the event persists, the event will also remain active (its lifetime is set to its
    original lifetime. Diplomacy is one-dimensional for now. Thus, an event has a value (rel_change)
    to change the current diplomatic value.
    For future iteration, a multidimensional setup can be imagined for more complex relations
    An event is defined by its location. If the cause of the event moves, it will be triggered again.
    Example a hostile army invades the claimed territory, one can throw an event with lifetime one to track
    the army and to make sure, that no events are accumulated for the same cause.

    IMPORTANT (!): If diplomacy is used, one has to call AI_Diplo.calc_round() per turn (do_move) to update the
    events
